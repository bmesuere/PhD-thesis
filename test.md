# Taxonomic analysis of a tryptic peptide

Because most proteins are simply to large to be analysed using a mass spectrometer, they are usually cleaved into smaller peptides before the actual MS analysis takes place. In practice, most proteomics studies achieve such a cleavage by adding trypsin to a protein sample. Trypsin is a serine protease found in the digestive system of humans and many other vertebrates, where it helps to digest food proteins. The enzyme has a very specific function â€” it only cleaves [peptide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide) chains at the [carboxyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyl) side of the [amino acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids) [lysine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine) (represented by the letter `K`) or [arginine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine) (represented by the letter `R`). As a result, it is commonly used in biological research during [proteomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics) experiments to digest proteins into peptides for mass spectrometry analysis, e.g. [in-gel digestion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-gel_digestion).

*High-performance liquid chromatography* (HPLC) is a [chromatographic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography) technique used to separate the components in a mixture, to identify each component, and to quantify each component. When combined with *shotgun tandem* mass spectrometric methods, the active proteins within a biological sample may be determined. A trypsin digest is used to cleave the proteins in a sample downstream to every `K` (lysine) or `R` (arginine), except when followed by `P` (proline). The individual components that result after the cleavage step are called *tryptic peptides*. The amino acid sequence of these tryptic peptides may then be determined by means of mass spectrometry. However, most devices have a detection limit that only allows to determine the amino acid sequence of peptides having a length between 5 and 50 amino acids (Figure 1).

Figure 1:  Tryptic digestion is a necessary step in protein absorption as proteins are generally too large to be absorbed through the lining of the small intestine. Trypsin predominantly cleaves proteins at the carboxyl side (or "C-terminal side") of the amino acids lysine (`K`) and arginine (`R`) except when either is bound to a C-terminal proline (`P`).

By searching for all proteins that contain a particular tryptic peptide that was sequenced from an environmental sample, we can get insight into the biodiversity and functionality of the biological sample. The [Unipept](http://unipept.ugent.be) web application supports biodiversity analysis of large and complex metaproteome samples using tryptic peptide information obtained from shotgun MS/MS experiments. Its underlying index structure is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a tryptic peptide in UniProtKB records.

Figure 2: General outline of the Unipept workflow for taxonomic identification of tryptic peptides. For a given tryptic peptide, all UniProt records having an exact match of the peptide in the protein sequence are found. Unipept then computes the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the taxonomic annotations extracted from the matched UniProt records, based on a cleaned up version of the NCBI Taxonomy. All intermediate results are shown for the sample tryptic peptide `ENFVY[IL]AK` (isoleucine and leucine equated), leading to an LCA in the phylum *Streptophyta*. Arrows at the bottom show which processing steps are available as functions in the [Unipept API](???) and the [Unipept CLI](???).

Before the Unipept command line interface (CLI) can be used, it first needs to be installed locally. Since the commands of the CLI are implemented in Ruby, [the Ruby environment must be installed first](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (at least version 1.9). The Unipept CLI can then be installed using the `gem`command, which is the RubyGems package manager for the Ruby programming language.

```
$ gem install  unipept
Successfully installed unipept-0.5.7
1 gem installed
Installing ri documentation for unipept-0.5.7...
Installing RDoc documentation for unipept-0.5.7...
```

By default, the `gem` command installs the Unipept CLI for all users on the computer system. To make a personal installation or in case you don't have the necessary submissions for the appropriate directories to make a system-wide installation, you can use the option `--user-install` of the `gem` command.

The Unipept CLI is a bundle of different commands that all come with detailed online documentation. Naturally, the most important command is `unipept`.

```
$ unipept --help

COMMANDS
    config
    help          show help
    pept2lca      Give lowest common ancestor for given peptide
    pept2prot     Give protein information for given peptides
    pept2taxa     Single Peptide Search
    taxa2lca      Give lowest common ancestor for taxon ids
    taxonomy      Give NCBI taxonomy information on given input taxon ids

OPTIONS
    -f --format     output format (available: json,csv,xml) (default: csv)
    -h --help       show help for this command
       --host       Override host setting
    -i --input      input file
    -o --output     output file
    -q --quiet      don't show update messages
    -v --version    print version
```

As the `unipept` command makes calls to the Unipept API that is provided by an instance of the Unipept application server (web services that communicate with an instance of the Unipept database), the location of the Unipept application server must be configured. This can be done by passing the URL of the server as an argument to the option `--host`. To avoid that the server needs to be specified with each use of the `unipept` command, the server can be configured once using the `unipept config` subcommand. If an argument is explicitly passed to a command line option, this value always takes precedence over the value that has been preconfigured for this option. This allows to override a default setting on a single occasion.

```
$ unipept --host 'api.unipept.ugent.be' pept2lca ENFVYIAK
peptide,taxon_id,taxon_name,taxon_rank
ENFVYIAK,35493,Streptophyta,phylum
$ unipept config host='api.unipept.ugent.be'
$ unipept pept2lca ENFVYIAK
peptide,taxon_id,taxon_name,taxon_rank
ENFVYIAK,35493,Streptophyta,phylum
```

The Unipept application server can also send out messages that can be picked up by the `unipept` command, and are shown on the terminal when its used interactively. These message can for example indicate that a newer version of the CLI is available. The RubyGems package manager makes it quite straightforward to update the CLI to the latest version.

```
$ unipept --version
Unipept 0.5.7 is released!
0.5.6
$ gem update unipept
Fetching: unipept-0.5.7.gem (100%)

Installing RDoc documentation for unipept-0.5.7...
$ unipept --version

```

Using the `unipept` command with a single tryptic peptide passed as an argument or read from standard input, corresponds to using the *Tryptic Peptide Analysis* feature from the Unipept web interface (Figure 3). Activating the option *Equate I and L* in the web interface corresponds to using the `-e` option with the `unipept` command.

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.ugent.be/COMPBIO2015/Unipept-CLI/blob/master/images/TPA.png" /></div>
Figure 3: Taxonomic identification of the tryptic peptide `ENFVYIAK` using the *Tryptic Peptide Analysis* feature from the Unipept web interface.

The `unipept pept2prot` command is an implementation of the `pept2prot` step in Figure 2. This command can therefore be used to fetch all UniProt proteins that contain (exact matching) the given tryptic peptide. These peptides are listed in the *Protein matches* tab on the page that shows the results of a Tryptic Peptide Analysis on the Unipept web interface. When the option `-a/--extra` is used, additional taxonomic and functional information is shown for each of the match protein records. These metadata are extracted directly from the annotations on the UniProt records. As such, the `unipept pept2prot` is also an implementation of the `prot2taxa` step in Figure 2.

The `unipept pept2taxa` command is the composition of the `pept2prot` and `prot2taxa` steps in Figure 2, apart from the fact that this command also implements a deduplication of the matched taxa. The command can thus be used to fetch all taxonomic annotations from all UniProt proteins that contain the given tryptic peptide. This information is represented in the Unipept web interface in tabular format (*Lineage table* tab) and in tree format (*Lineage tree* tab). All information included in the table can be retrieved using the `-a` option in combination with this command. The tree structure is only a compact representation of the complete lineages included in the table.

The `unipept pept2lca` command is the composition of the `pept2prot`, `prot2taxa` and `taxa2lca` steps in Figure 2. In other words, this command can be used to determine the taxonomic identification of a tryptic peptide. This is done by computing the lowest common ancestor (LCA) from all taxonomic annotations of the UniProt proteins that match the given tryptic peptide (Figure 2). This information can be found in the summary on top of the page that shows the results of a Tryptic Peptide Analysis in the Unipept web interface (Figure 4). The complete lineage can be retrieved using the `-a` option in combination with this command. Note that the computation of the LCA (`taxa2lca` step in Figure 4) can be done using the `unipept taxa2lca` command of the Unipept CLI.

Figure 4: Information about the lowest common ancestor of the tryptic peptide `ENFVYIAK`, as displayed on top of the page that shows the results of a Tryptic Peptide Analysis in the Unipept web interface.

Say that we have determined the mass spectrum of a tryptic peptide, that was identified as the peptide `ENFVYIAK` using database searches (`Mascot` (Cottrell & London, 1999), `Sequest` (Eng *et al.*, 1994), `X!Tandem` (Craig *et al.*, 2003)) or *de novo* identification (`PEAKS` (Ma *et al.*, 2003)). As an example, we show how this tryptic peptide can be taxonomically assigned to the phylum *Streptophyta*. As a starter, we can use the `unipept pept2prot` command to fetch all UniProt proteins indexed by Unipept that contain the peptide.

The following interactive session shows that UniProt contains 17 proteins that contain the tryptic peptide `ENFVYIAK`. Note that the first command passes the tryptic peptide as an argument to the `unipept pept2prot` command. In case no tryptic peptide is passed as an argument, the command reads a tryptic peptide from standard input as illustrated by the second command. Throughout this case study we will preferentially pass tryptic peptides as an argument to the `unipept pept2prot` command, but the command works the same way irrespective of how the tryptic peptide is fed to the command.

By default, the output is generated in CSV-format (*comma-separated values*). Apart from the query peptide (`peptide`), the output contains two GUID (*globally unique identifiers*): *i*) the _UniProt Accession Number_ (`uniprot_id`) that refers to the protein record in the UniProt database that contains the tryptic peptide and _ii_) the NCBI Taxonomy Identifier (`taxon_id`) assigned to the UniProt protein record that refers to a record in the NCBI Taxonomy Database (Sayers et al., 2011; Benson et al., 2013). The latter describes a taxon in the hierachical classification of cellular organisms, being the taxon from which the protein was extracted.

In peptide sequencing experiments involving a single step tandem mass acquisition, leucine (`L`) and isoleucine (`I`) are indistinguishable because both are characterized by a 113 Da mass difference from the other peptide fragments in the MS-MS spectrum. In general there are 2<sup>_n_</sup> `I=L` variants for each tryptic peptide that contains _n_ residues that are either leucine or isoleucine. Therefore, all subcommands of the `unipept` command that are based on matching given peptides against UniProt proteins support the `-e/--equate` option (*equate*). Exact matching makes no distinction between `I` and `L` when this option is activated.

Note that the Unipept database has two separate index structures to match tryptic peptides against UniProt protein records: one that is used to extactly match tryptic peptides against UniProt protein records and one that is used to exactly match all `I=L` variants of a given tryptic peptide. As a result, matching all `I=L` variants variants of the tryptic peptide `ENFVYIAK` can be done in a single step, without any performance loss.

Apart from a fast index that maps tryptic peptides onto the UniProt records of proteins that contain the peptide, the Unipept database contains minimal information about the proteins that was extracted from the UniProt records. This includes information about the taxon from which the protein was sequenced (`taxon_id` and `taxon_name`) and a description of the cellular functions the protein is involved in (`ec_references` and `go_references`). Taxonomic information is described using a GUID that refers to a record in the NCBI Taxonomy Database (Sayers et al., 2011; Benson et al., 2013). Functional information is described using GUIDs that refer to records from the Enzyme Commission classification (EC; Webb, 1992) and the Gene Ontology (GO; Ashburner et al., 2000). The generated output contains this additional information if the `-a/--extra` option of the `unipept` command is used. The following example is representative in the sense that the taxonomic information about proteins is generally more complete and accurate than the information about known functions of the proteins.

Because Unipept uses a separate peptide index in which `I` and `L` are equated, Unipept cannot directly resolve what specific `I=L` variant (or variants) of a tryptic peptide are contained in a protein sequence. However, the Unipept CLI supports the `uniprot` command that calls the UniProt web services. This can be used, for example, to retrieve all protein sequences for a given list of _UniProt Accession Numbers_. The following example also illustrates the `-s/--select` option of the `unipept` command, that can be used to include only a selected list of information fields in the generated output. Note that we add a series of additional processing steps to the result of the `uniprot` command, that only put the contained `I=L` variants in capitals (the remaining residues are convert into lower case) and truncate the protein sequences after a fixed number of residues.

The `uniprot` command can not only be used to fetch protein sequences from the UniProt database, but also all metadata that is available about the protein in UniProt. This can be done by passing a specific format to the `-f/--format` option of the `uniprot` command: `csv` default value, `fasta`, `xml`, `text`, `rdf` or `gff`. As an example, the following session fetches the first three proteins from UniProt that contain an `I=L` variant of the tryptic peptide `ENFVYIAK`. These proteins are returned in FASTA format.

```

Based on the taxonomic annotations contained in the UniProt records that match a given tryptic peptide, the tryptic peptide can be assigned taxonomically. To do so, Unipept makes use of an algorithm that computes the _lowest common ancestor_ (LCA) of all taxa in which the peptide was found. The implementation of this algorithm in Unipept is robust against taxonomic misarrangements, misidentifications, and inaccuracies. Unipept computes the LCA based on the _Unipept Taxonomy_, a cleaned up version of the NCBI Taxonomy that heuristically invalidates some "unnatural" taxa from the original database based on a set of regular expressions. Not taking into account this identification noise would otherwise result in drastic loss of information.

Apart from the LCA algorithm implemented by Unipept, it is also possible to come up with alternative aggregation scenarios that are implemented *client side* based on the NCBI Taxonomy Identifiers that are associated with the matched UniProt protein records. Scenarios that are based on the Unipept Taxonomy can be implemented by using the `unipept pept2taxa` command that outputs all taxa associated with the Uniprot proteins that contain a given tryptic peptide.

This output corresponds to the tree structure that appears at the left of Figure 2 or the tree drawn in the *Lineage tree* tab on the page that shows the results of a Tryptic Peptide Analysis in the Unipept web interface. Note that the tryptic peptide `ENFVYLAK` was only found in a peach protein (_Prunus persica_), whereas its `I=L` variant was found in proteins of a species of wild banana (_Musa acuminata_ subsp. _malaccensis_) and in different members of the flowering plants including chick pea (_Cicer arietinum_), broad been (_Vicia faba_), soybean (_Glycine max_), common bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), barrel medic (_Medicago truncatula_), orange (_Citrus sinensis_), clementine (_Citrus clementina_) and common grape vine (_Vitis vinifera_).

The Unipept implementation of the LCA algorithm can be applied on a given tryptic peptide using the `unipept pept2lca` command. Using the `-e` option will again have an influence on the LCA computation for the tryptic peptide `ENFVYIAK`. After all, the LCA will be computed for all taxa associated with proteins in which the tryptic peptide (or one of its `I=L` variants) was found.

The correctness of the computed LCAs can be checked based on the taxonomic hierarchy shown in Figure 2.
